## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### Step 1: Build Production AAB

You have **TWO OPTIONS** for building:

#### Option A: EAS Build (Cloud - Recommended for First Time)

Run this command to create a production build:
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

**What this does:**
- Creates an Android App Bundle (.aab) file
- Automatically handles code signing with EAS credentials
- Auto-increments version number (configured in eas.json)
- Injects environment variables from eas.json

**Expected Output:**
- Build will start on EAS servers
- You'll get a URL to monitor build progress
- Build typically takes 10-20 minutes
- Once complete, you'll get a download link for the .aab file

**Pros:** No local setup, automatic credentials, great for CI/CD  
**Cons:** Takes 15-20 minutes, requires internet

---

#### Option B: Local Build (Faster if you have Android Studio)

If you're already using `npx expo run:android --variant release`, here's what you need:

```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Your usual command creates APK, but Play Store needs AAB!

# Correct command for Play Store (creates AAB):
cd android && ./gradlew app:bundleRelease

# Output location:
# android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

**What this does:**
- Builds AAB locally on your machine (not APK)
- Uses your existing keystore/credentials
- Much faster (2-5 minutes)
- Gives you full control

**Prerequisites:**
- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK configured
- `android/` folder exists (run `npx expo prebuild` if needed)

**Pros:** Much faster, works offline, full control  
**Cons:** Requires Android Studio setup, manual credential management

üìö **See `LOCAL_BUILD_GUIDE.md` for complete local build documentation**

### Step 2: Set Up Google Play Console

#### 2a. Create App in Google Play Console
1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Click "Create App"
3. Fill in details:
   - **App name:** insaty
   - **Default language:** Choose your language
   - **App or game:** App
   - **Free or paid:** Free (or Paid if applicable)
4. Accept declarations and create app

#### 2b. Set Up Service Account (for automated submissions)

This is optional but recommended for future automated deployments.

1. In Google Play Console ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API Access
2. Create a new service account or link existing one
3. Download the JSON key file
4. Save it as `service-account-file.json` in your project root
5. Add to `.gitignore`:
   ```
   service-account-file.json
   ```

6. Update `eas.json` submit section:
   ```json
   {
     "submit": {
       "production": {
         "android": {
           "serviceAccountKeyPath": "./service-account-file.json",
           "track": "internal"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

**Tracks explained:**
- `internal` - Internal testing (up to 100 testers)
- `alpha` - Closed testing
- `beta` - Open testing
- `production` - Full public release

### Step 3: Complete Store Listing

In Google Play Console, complete all required sections:

#### App Content
1. **Privacy Policy** - Required for all apps
   - Host your privacy policy URL
   - Add the URL in Play Console

2. **App Access** - Declare if login is required
   - If yes, provide test credentials

3. **Ads** - Declare if your app contains ads

4. **Content Rating** - Complete questionnaire
   - Takes 5-10 minutes
   - Required before publishing

5. **Target Audience** - Select age groups

6. **Data Safety** - Declare data collection practices
   - What data you collect
   - How it's used
   - Security practices

#### Store Presence
1. **Main Store Listing**
   - App name: insaty
   - Short description (80 chars max)
   - Full description (4000 chars max)
   - Screenshots (minimum 2, up to 8)
   - Feature graphic (1024 x 500 px)
   - App icon (512 x 512 px)

2. **Screenshots Requirements:**
   - Minimum: 2 screenshots
   - Format: PNG or JPEG
   - Dimensions: 
     - Phone: 16:9 or 9:16 aspect ratio
     - Min: 320px, Max: 3840px
   - Show key features of your app

### Step 4: Submit Your Build

#### Option A: Manual Upload (First Time)
1. In Play Console ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Internal testing (or Production)
2. Click "Create new release"
3. Upload the .aab file you downloaded from EAS
4. Add release notes
5. Review and roll out

#### Option B: Automated with EAS Submit (After service account setup)
```bash
# Submit the build automatically
eas submit --platform android

# Or build and submit in one command
eas build --platform android --auto-submit
```

### Step 5: Review and Publish

1. **Internal Testing** (Recommended first)
   - Test with a small group first
   - Add tester emails in Play Console
   - They'll receive an invite link
   - Gather feedback and fix issues

2. **Production Release**
   - Once testing is complete
   - Go to Production track
   - Upload build or promote from testing
   - Add release notes
   - Review and publish

**Review Time:**
- Google typically reviews within 1-7 days
- First submission usually takes longer
- Updates are usually faster

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Check build logs
eas build:list

# View specific build details
eas build:view [BUILD_ID]
```

### Common Issues

1. **Keystore/Signing Issues**
   - EAS handles this automatically
   - If issues occur, run: `eas credentials`

2. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Check `eas.json` production env section
   - Verify variable names start with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`

3. **Version Conflicts**
   - EAS auto-increments if `autoIncrement: true`
   - Manual override: `eas build:version:set`

---

## üì± Testing Your Build

### Install on Physical Device
```bash
# Download and install the build
eas build:run -p android
```

### Generate Internal Testing Link
1. Upload build to Internal testing track
2. Add testers' Gmail addresses
3. Share the testing link with them

---

## üîÑ Future Updates

### Update Process:
1. Make code changes
2. Build new version: `eas build --platform android --profile production`
3. Submit: `eas submit --platform android --auto-submit`
4. Add release notes in Play Console
5. Publish update

### Version Management:
- `autoIncrement: true` in eas.json handles version bumping
- Manual control: `eas build:version:set`

---

## üìö Useful Commands

```bash
# Login to EAS
eas login

# Build production
eas build --platform android --profile production

# Submit to Play Store
eas submit --platform android

# Build and submit together
eas build --platform android --auto-submit

# Check build status

   - Prepare app screenshots
   - Write app description
   - Create privacy policy
   - Prepare feature graphic

3. **After build completes:**
   - Test the build on a physical device
   - Create Play Console app listing
