# 🔧 Edge Function JSON Parse Error - Fix Applied

## What Was Wrong

1. **Missing deno.json** - Edge Functions need a `deno.json` file to properly manage npm dependencies
2. **Incorrect imports** - Using `npm:` prefix directly in imports can cause issues
3. **Poor error handling** - Client wasn't handling empty/malformed responses properly

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Created `supabase/functions/upload-to-r2/deno.json`
```json
{
  "imports": {
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "npm:@supabase/supabase-js@2",
    "@aws-sdk/client-s3": "npm:@aws-sdk/client-s3@3.682.0",
    "@aws-sdk/lib-storage": "npm:@aws-sdk/lib-storage@3.682.0"
  }
}
```

This tells Deno how to resolve the npm packages properly.

### 2. Updated Edge Function Imports
```typescript
// ✅ NEW (uses deno.json aliases)
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { Upload } from '@aws-sdk/lib-storage';
```

### 3. Enhanced Client Error Handling
- Now reads response as text first
- Checks if response is empty
- Parses JSON with try-catch
- Shows actual server response in error messages

### 4. Enhanced Server Error Handling
- Always returns valid JSON, even on catastrophic errors
- Includes error details for debugging
- Logs full error stack

## 🚀 Deploy Now

**Via Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to **Edge Functions** → **upload-to-r2**
2. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to upload BOTH files:
   - `index.ts` (updated)
   - `deno.json` (new)
3. Click Deploy

**Via CLI (if available):**
```bash
cd c:\projects\startup\fromgit02062025\podup
supabase functions deploy upload-to-r2
```

The CLI will automatically include `deno.json` when deploying.

## 🧪 Test Again

1. **Restart your app:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. **Try uploading** (check console logs for detailed output)

3. **Check what you should see in terminal:**
   ```
   📥 Response status: 200
   📥 Response text: {"success":true,"url":"https://...
   ✅ Upload successful: https://pub-xxx.r2.dev/images/...
   ```

4. **If it fails**, you'll see the actual server response:
   ```
   📥 Response status: 500
   📥 Response text: {"success":false,"error":"...","details":"..."}
   ```

## 🔍 Check Edge Function Logs

After deploying, test and immediately check logs in:
**Supabase Dashboard** → **Edge Functions** → **upload-to-r2** → **Logs**

You should see:
- ✅ No more "fs.readFile is not implemented" errors
- ✅ No more JSON parse errors
- ✅ Successful uploads with "📤 Uploading..." and "✅ Upload successful"

## Why This Works

- **deno.json** is the recommended way to manage dependencies in Supabase Edge Functions
- It ensures proper package resolution and prevents filesystem access issues
- The AWS SDK now loads correctly without trying to read config files from disk

## 📚 Reference

- [Supabase Docs: Managing Dependencies](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/dependencies)
- Official recommendation: Use function-specific `deno.json` files

---

**Status:** ✅ Ready to deploy
**Files to upload:** `index.ts` + `deno.json`
**Expected result:** Successful uploads with no JSON parse errors
