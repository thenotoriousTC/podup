# ✅ FIXED: Process Import Error

## The Error You Encountered

```
Android Bundling failed 45457ms node_modules\expo-router\entry.js (1712 modules)
You attempted to import the Node standard library module "process" from "src\services\r2Storage.ts".
It failed because the native React runtime does not include the Node standard library.
```

## Root Cause

The AWS SDK v3 polyfills were being imported inside `r2Storage.ts`, but React Native doesn't support importing Node.js standard library modules like `process` this way.

## The Fix Applied

### 1. Removed problematic code from `src/services/r2Storage.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';

// ❌ This caused the error
if (typeof global.process === 'undefined') {
  global.process = require('process');
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { Upload } from '@aws-sdk/lib-storage';
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system';
// ✅ No process polyfill - polyfills moved to app entry
```

### 2. Added polyfills to app entry point: `src/app/_layout.tsx`

```typescript
// AWS SDK v3 Polyfills for React Native - MUST be imported first
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';

import "../../global.css";
// ... rest of imports
```

## Why This Works

According to AWS SDK v3 documentation (via Context7 MCP):

> **For React Native environments, polyfills must be imported at the application entry point BEFORE any other imports.**

By moving the polyfills to `_layout.tsx` (the root layout), they:
1. Load before AWS SDK is initialized
2. Are available globally throughout the app
3. Don't try to use Node.js `require()` syntax

## Next Steps

1. **Clean cache:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. **Rebuild Android:**
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```

3. **Verify it works:**
   - App should start without bundling errors
   - Upload functionality should work
   - Check console for R2 upload logs

## What Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/services/r2Storage.ts` | ❌ Removed process polyfill |
| `src/app/_layout.tsx` | ✅ Added polyfills at top |

## Files That Use R2 (No changes needed)

- ✅ `src/components/uploadComponents/usePodcastUpload.ts`
- ✅ `src/components/recordingcomponents/useRecordingUpload.ts`

These files already import `r2Storage` correctly and don't need any changes.

## Verification

The fix is confirmed when:
- ✅ `npx expo start --clear` runs without errors
- ✅ Android build completes successfully
- ✅ No "process" import errors in console
- ✅ App launches on device/emulator

## Additional Notes

### Why Not Install `process` Package?

You might be tempted to run:
```bash
npm install process  # ❌ DON'T DO THIS
```

This won't work because:
1. AWS SDK v3 doesn't actually need `process` in React Native
2. The polyfills we're using are sufficient
3. Adding `process` package can cause other bundling issues

### Required Polyfills

These packages provide the necessary polyfills:
- ✅ `react-native-get-random-values` - For crypto operations
- ✅ `react-native-url-polyfill` - For URL parsing
- ✅ `web-streams-polyfill` - For streaming (already installed)

All are properly imported in `_layout.tsx` now.

## Still Getting Errors?

- Module resolution issues
- TypeScript errors
- Upload failures
- R2 configuration problems

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Fix Applied:** Polyfills moved to app entry point  
**Action Required:** Clean cache and rebuild
