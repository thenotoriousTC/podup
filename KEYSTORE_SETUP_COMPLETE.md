# ✅ Keystore Setup Complete!

## What Was Configured:

### 1. ✅ gradle.properties
- Keystore file: `my-release-key.keystore`
- Key alias: `my-key-alias`
- Passwords configured
- Location: `android/gradle.properties`

### 2. ✅ build.gradle
- Release signing config added
- Reads credentials from gradle.properties
- Location: `android/app/build.gradle`

### 3. ✅ .gitignore
- Protected keystore files (*.keystore)
- Protected gradle.properties
- **Your passwords won't be committed to Git!**

---

## 🔐 Final Step: Create/Place Your Keystore

You need the actual keystore file. Choose one option:

### Option A: Generate New Keystore (If you don't have one)

```bash
cd android/app

keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 \
  -keystore my-release-key.keystore \
  -alias my-key-alias \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000
```

**When prompted:**
- Enter keystore password: `TAKItaki123`
- Re-enter password: `TAKItaki123`
- Enter key password: `TAKItaki123` (or press Enter to use same)
- Fill in the certificate details (or press Enter to skip)

### Option B: Use Existing Keystore (If you already have one)

Copy your existing keystore to:
```
android/app/my-release-key.keystore
```

---

## 🚀 Build Your App Now!

Once the keystore is in place:

```bash
# Navigate to android directory
cd android

# Build AAB for Play Store
./gradlew app:bundleRelease

# Output will be at:
# android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before building, verify:

- [ ] Keystore file exists at: `android/app/my-release-key.keystore`
- [ ] gradle.properties has correct credentials
- [ ] build.gradle has release signing config
- [ ] .gitignore protects sensitive files
- [ ] You've backed up your keystore (very important!)

---

## 📦 Build Commands

### Build AAB (for Play Store):
```bash
cd android && ./gradlew app:bundleRelease
```

### Build APK (for testing):
```bash
cd android && ./gradlew app:assembleRelease
```

### Clean build (if issues):
```bash
cd android && ./gradlew clean && ./gradlew app:bundleRelease
```

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Backup Your Keystore!

**Your keystore is IRREPLACEABLE!**

1. **Backup the keystore file** to a secure location
2. **Save your passwords** somewhere safe
3. **Without this keystore, you CANNOT update your app on Play Store**

Backup locations:
- External hard drive
- Cloud storage (encrypted)
- Password manager
- Secure offline location

---

## 🔍 Verify Signing

After building, verify your APK/AAB is signed:

```bash
# For AAB
cd android
./gradlew app:bundleRelease
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

# For APK
./gradlew app:assembleRelease
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

You should see "jar verified" if signing is successful.

---

## 📱 Test Your Build

```bash
# Install APK on connected device
cd android
./gradlew app:assembleRelease
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

---

## 🎯 Next: Upload to Play Store

Once you have the AAB file:

1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Create app (if not done)
3. Navigate to: Production → Create new release
4. Upload: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
5. Add release notes
6. Submit for review

---

## 📄 File Structure

```
android/
├── app/
│   ├── my-release-key.keystore  ← Your keystore (DO NOT COMMIT)
│   └── build.gradle              ← Signing config
└── gradle.properties             ← Credentials (DO NOT COMMIT)

.gitignore                        ← Protects sensitive files
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Could not find keystore"
- Make sure keystore is at: `android/app/my-release-key.keystore`
- Check the file name matches exactly

### "Keystore was tampered with, or password was incorrect"
- Verify passwords in gradle.properties match keystore password
- Check for typos

### "Cannot recover key"
- Make sure key password matches in gradle.properties
- Try using the same password for both store and key

### Build fails with signing error
```bash
# Check your signing config
cd android
./gradlew signingReport
```

## ✅ You're Ready!

Your configuration is now complete. Just:

1. **Create/place your keystore file**
2. **Run the build command**
3. **Upload to Play Store**

**Good luck with your launch! 🚀**
