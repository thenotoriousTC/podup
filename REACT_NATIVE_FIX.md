# üîß React Native Blob Fix

## Issue
Error: `Creating blobs from 'ArrayBuffer' and 'ArrayBufferView' are not supported`

## Root Cause
React Native doesn't support creating Blobs from ArrayBuffer the same way browsers do. The original code was trying to:
1. Read file as base64
2. Convert to Uint8Array
3. Create Blob from Uint8Array ‚ùå (Not supported in RN)

## Solution
Use React Native's native FormData API which accepts file objects with `uri`, `type`, and `name` properties:

```typescript
// ‚ùå OLD (Browser-style - doesn't work in RN)
const blob = new Blob([byteArray], { type: mimeType });
formData.append('file', blob, fileName);

// ‚úÖ NEW (React Native-style)
formData.append('file', {
  uri: fileUri,      // File path on device
  type: mimeType,    // MIME type
  name: fileName,    // Filename
} as any);
```

## Files Fixed
1. `src/components/uploadComponents/usePodcastUpload.ts`
2. `src/components/recordingcomponents/useRecordingUpload.ts`

## Key Changes
- Removed base64 encoding/decoding
- Use file URI directly in FormData
- Changed from `supabase.functions.invoke()` to `fetch()` for better FormData handling
- Simpler, more efficient code

## Test Now
```bash
# Restart the app
npx expo start --clear

# Test upload from file picker
# Test upload from recording
```

Should work without errors now! ‚úÖ
