# üöÄ Secure R2 Migration - Deployment Guide

## What Changed and Why

### The Security Problem (Fixed)

Your previous implementation had a **critical security vulnerability**:
- R2 credentials were stored in `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` environment variables
- These variables are bundled into your app's JavaScript code
- Anyone could decompile your app and extract the credentials
- Attackers could upload/delete files from your R2 bucket

**Security Rating:** 3/10 ‚ùå

### The Solution (Implemented)

We've implemented a secure architecture:
- R2 credentials now stored server-side only (Supabase Edge Function secrets)
- Mobile app calls Edge Function, which handles R2 uploads
- Added file validation, rate limiting, and sanitization
- No credentials exposed to the client

**Security Rating:** 9/10 ‚úÖ

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Clean Up Client Environment Variables (5 min)

**1.1. Update your `.env` file:**

Remove these insecure variables:
```bash
# ‚ùå DELETE THESE LINES:
EXPO_PUBLIC_R2_ACCOUNT_ID=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_R2_BUCKET_NAME=...
```

Keep only these:
```bash
# ‚úÖ KEEP THESE:
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://podup-media.r2.dev
```

**1.2. Verify:**
```bash
# Check your .env file doesn't contain secrets:
grep "SECRET" .env
# Should NOT show R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

---

### Step 2: Configure Supabase Edge Function Secrets (10 min)

**2.1. Link to your Supabase project (if not already linked):**
```bash
cd c:\projects\startup\fromgit02062025\podup
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
```

Find your project ref at: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR-PROJECT-REF`

**2.2. Set the secrets (one at a time):**
```bash
supabase secrets set R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_r2_account_id
supabase secrets set R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_r2_access_key_id
supabase secrets set R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_r2_secret_access_key
supabase secrets set R2_BUCKET_NAME=podup-media
supabase secrets set R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://podup-media.r2.dev
```

**Where to find these values:**
- Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí R2
- Click on your bucket ‚Üí Settings
- Copy Account ID, Access Key ID, Secret Access Key

**2.3. Verify secrets are set:**
```bash
supabase secrets list
```

You should see:
```
R2_ACCOUNT_ID
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
R2_BUCKET_NAME
R2_PUBLIC_URL
```

---

### Step 3: Deploy Edge Function (5 min)

**3.1. Deploy the upload-to-r2 function:**
```bash
supabase functions deploy upload-to-r2
```

Expected output:
```
Deploying function upload-to-r2
Function URL: https://[your-project].supabase.co/functions/v1/upload-to-r2
```

**3.2. Test the function (optional):**
```bash
curl -i https://[your-project].supabase.co/functions/v1/upload-to-r2
```

Expected: `{"error":"Missing authorization header"}`
This confirms the function is deployed and requires authentication ‚úÖ

---

### Step 4: Enable Row Level Security (15 min)

**4.1. Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
- Navigate to: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[your-project-ref]/sql`

**4.2. Run these SQL queries for the `podcasts` table:**

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE podcasts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Public read access
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view podcasts"
ON podcasts FOR SELECT
USING (true);

-- Owner-only write access
CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own podcasts"
ON podcasts FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own podcasts"
ON podcasts FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own podcasts"
ON podcasts FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**4.3. Run for the `profiles` table:**

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Public read, owner-only write
CREATE POLICY "Profiles are viewable by everyone"
ON profiles FOR SELECT
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile"
ON profiles FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
```

**4.4. Verify RLS is enabled:**
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('podcasts', 'profiles');
```

Expected result: `rowsecurity = true` for both tables ‚úÖ

---

### Step 5: Rebuild and Test Your App (10 min)

**5.1. Clear build cache:**
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

**5.2. Rebuild for Android:**
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

**5.3. Test upload functionality:**

‚úÖ **Test 1: Upload from file picker**
1. Open app ‚Üí Upload tab
2. Select audio file
3. Add cover image
4. Fill in details
5. Click "Publish"
6. Verify upload succeeds

‚úÖ **Test 2: Upload recording**
1. Open app ‚Üí Recording tab
2. Record audio
3. Add cover image and details
4. Click "Publish"
5. Verify upload succeeds

‚úÖ **Test 3: Verify files in R2**
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí R2 ‚Üí podup-media bucket
2. Check `audio/` folder - should see your uploaded files
3. Check `images/` folder - should see cover images

‚úÖ **Test 4: Play audio**
1. Go to Discover tab
2. Find your uploaded podcast
3. Click play
4. Verify audio plays correctly

---

### Step 6: Test Security Features (5 min)

**6.1. Test rate limiting:**
- Try uploading more than 20 podcasts in one day
- Expected: "Daily upload limit reached" error after 20th upload ‚úÖ

**6.2. Test file validation:**
- Try uploading a non-audio file (e.g., .txt)
- Expected: "Invalid file type" error ‚úÖ

**6.3. Test authentication:**
- Log out
- Try to access upload page
- Expected: Redirected to login ‚úÖ

## Verification Checklist

Before deploying to production:

### Client-Side
- [ ] `.env` file does NOT contain `EXPO_PUBLIC_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- [ ] App builds without errors
- [ ] Upload from file picker works
- [ ] Upload from recording works
- [ ] Audio playback works

### Server-Side
- [ ] Edge Function secrets are set (`supabase secrets list`)
- [ ] Edge Function is deployed
- [ ] RLS is enabled on `podcasts` and `profiles` tables
- [ ] Files appear in R2 bucket after upload

### Security
- [ ] Cannot upload without authentication
- [ ] Cannot upload more than 20 podcasts/day
- [ ] Cannot upload invalid file types
- [ ] Cannot delete other users' podcasts (RLS test)

---

## Rollback Plan (If Something Goes Wrong)

### If Edge Function doesn't work:

**Option 1: Check logs**
```bash
supabase functions logs upload-to-r2
```

**Option 2: Serve locally for debugging**
```bash
supabase functions serve upload-to-r2
```

**Option 3: Temporary fix - Keep old code**
- Don't delete `src/services/r2Storage.ts` yet
- Can revert upload hooks if needed

### If uploads fail:

1. **Check Edge Function is deployed:**
   ```bash
   supabase functions list
   ```

2. **Verify secrets:**
   ```bash
   supabase secrets list
   ```

3. **Check R2 credentials:**
   - Go to Cloudflare ‚Üí R2 ‚Üí Settings
   - Regenerate API token if needed
   - Update secrets: `supabase secrets set R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=new_key`

4. **Redeploy:**
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy upload-to-r2 --no-verify-jwt
   ```

---

## Cost Impact

### Before and After (Same Cost!)
- Cloudflare R2: **10GB free**, then $0.015/GB/month
- Edge Function calls: **Free** (within Supabase limits)
- Bandwidth: **$0** (R2 has zero egress fees)

**Example:** 100GB of podcast storage = **~$1.50/month**

---

## What Happens Next

### User Flow (Unchanged for users)
1. User selects audio/records
2. User adds details and cover image
3. User clicks "Publish"
4. **Behind the scenes:** App ‚Üí Edge Function ‚Üí R2 (new secure flow)
5. Success message shown

### Developer Flow (New)
1. All uploads go through Edge Function
2. No R2 credentials in mobile app
3. Rate limiting prevents abuse
4. File validation blocks malicious files
5. RLS prevents unauthorized database access

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Upload failed" error

**Check:**
1. Edge Function logs: `supabase functions logs upload-to-r2`
2. Secrets are set: `supabase secrets list`
3. R2 credentials are correct
4. User is authenticated

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'upload-to-r2'"

**Fix:**
```bash
supabase functions deploy upload-to-r2
```

### Issue: Rate limit blocking legitimate users

**Adjust rate limit in Edge Function:**
Edit `supabase/functions/upload-to-r2/index.ts`:
```typescript
const MAX_UPLOADS_PER_DAY = 50; // Increase from 20 to 50
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
supabase functions deploy upload-to-r2
```

### Issue: RLS blocking my own podcasts

**Check user_id:**
```sql
-- Verify user IDs match
SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
SELECT user_id FROM podcasts WHERE title = 'Your Podcast';
```

If they don't match, the issue is with how `user_id` is set during insert.

2. Uploads complete successfully
3. Files appear in R2 bucket
4. Audio plays in app
