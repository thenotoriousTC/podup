Podcast Series Episode Management


Me

i want to make a drastic change to the app without affecting the old version of the app , meaning we just don't change field names or storage names or table names on supabase , what i want is every podcast to be part of a series , let's take joe rogan for example , he has to series of podcasts , one for famous guests and another one for MMA guests , each podcast contains a series of episodes , i think that's understood so far , i think the change that i want also requires us to create a table for series and link it to the already present podcasts table , provide a plan on how we can approach this safely .

Of course. Introducing a "series" concept is a great way to structure content. Doing it safely without disrupting the current users is key. Here is a phased plan to approach this significant change.

Phase 1: Database Schema & Migration
This is the most critical part. We'll make additive changes to the database to ensure the old version of the app continues to work without any modifications.

Create a series Table: I will add a new table in Supabase called series. It will store information about each podcast series. The columns would be something like:
id (Primary Key)
title (e.g., "Famous Guests")
description
cover_art_url
creator_id (Foreign Key to the profiles table)
created_at
Update the podcasts Table: I will add a new, nullable series_id column to your existing podcasts table.
This series_id will be a foreign key that links to the new series table.
Making it nullable is the crucial step for backward compatibility. For the old app, this column will just be null and won't affect existing queries. The new app version will be built to handle it.
Phase 2: Backend Logic (Supabase RPCs/Views)
If you are using any Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) or database views to fetch podcast data, we will need to create new versions of them that account for the series relationship, leaving the old ones untouched for the current app.

Phase 3: Application Code (React Native)
This is where we'll build the new features in the app itself. The work will be split into features for creators and listeners.

For Creators:
Series Management: Build new screens for creators to create, view, edit, and delete their series.
Episode-to-Series Linking: Modify the podcast creation/editing screen ((protected)/creator/[id].tsx seems like a good place to start) to allow creators to assign a podcast (now an "episode") to one of their series.
For Listeners:
UI Redesign: Update the UI to display podcasts grouped by series. This will likely involve changes to the profile/channel view ((protected)/(tabs)/profile.tsx) and any components that list podcasts (PodcastsList.tsx).
Data Fetching: Update the app's data-fetching logic to first get the series for a creator and then the episodes within each series.
Execution Plan
To begin, I will start with Phase 1. I need to examine your current codebase to understand how you interact with Supabase and what your current podcasts table looks like.

I'll start by listing the contents of the src directory to get a better overview of the project structure.

Excellent. Now that I have a high-level overview of your project structure, I'll proceed with the plan. The next logical step is to understand how your application currently interacts with the database, specifically concerning podcasts. This will help me formulate the exact database changes needed.

Based on the structure and the memories provided, your Supabase client and type definitions are most likely located in the src/lib directory. I'll list its contents to confirm.

Great, 
supabase.ts
 is right where I expected it. Now, I'll examine its contents. This will give me insight into your Supabase setup and, most importantly, show me the TypeScript definitions for your database tables, including the podcasts table. This is essential for planning the exact SQL statements for the database migration.

I will now view the contents of 
src/lib/supabase.ts
.
