Atomic Podcast Upload with Lottie Animation


Me

we also have a slight problem , my friend tried to upload a podcast and audio file was too big that he aborted the process, but the image got uploaded and iit's now in supabase storage , so there is only the image taking space and the audio didn't get uploaded and table row didn't get added , so we need to a solution here , how can we upload them all at once , if one of them fail the others don't get uploaded ?

Of course. This is a classic problem when dealing with multi-step operations that should be atomic. If one part fails, the whole operation should be rolled back to avoid leaving orphaned data, like the image you described.

To solve this, we can't use a traditional database transaction because it involves file storage. Instead, we'll implement a "two-phase commit" pattern using a Supabase Edge Function. This moves the sensitive logic to the backend, making it more secure and robust.

Here is the plan:

Create a Supabase Edge Function: This function will handle the entire podcast creation process.
Upload Files to a Temporary Location: The app will upload the image and audio directly to a temporary folder in your Supabase bucket (e.g., temp/).
Verify and Move Files: The Edge Function will be triggered with the paths to the temporary files. It will:
Verify that both files exist.
Insert the new podcast record into your database table.
If the database insert is successful, it will move the files from the temp/ folder to their permanent location (e.g., podcasts/).
If any step fails, it will delete the temporary files, ensuring no orphaned data is left.
This approach guarantees that the database record is only created if both files are successfully uploaded and processed.

First, I need to understand your current upload implementation. I'll start by examining the UPLOAD.tsx file where your UploadScreen component is located. <tool_code>

I've reviewed the 
UPLOAD.tsx
 file and see the 
handleUpload
 function. It uploads the image, then the audio, and finally creates the database record. This is where the issue lies.

I'll now create a Supabase Edge Function to make this process atomic. This will ensure the podcast is only created if both files are successfully uploaded. I'll start by creating the Edge Function file.

I will now create the file c:\projects\startup\fromgit02062025\podup\supabase\functions\create-podcast\index.ts. After that, I will add the code to this file.

Great, the file is created. Now I'll add the code for the Edge Function.

This function will handle the logic for creating a new podcast entry. It will first insert the podcast details into the database, and only if that's successful will it move the uploaded files from a temporary location to their final destination. If anything goes wrong, it will clean up any temporary files to prevent orphans.

This makes the whole operation atomic. I will now write the code to 
supabase/functions/create-podcast/index.ts
.
