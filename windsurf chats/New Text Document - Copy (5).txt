Me

from discover page i click on standalone podcasts card , and it takes me to its detail page ,and there i can also listen to it or read about it . give me all the files responsible for this and how data flows , go deep , because we need to understand that so we can implement it in another page

Of course. To understand the flow from the discover page to a standalone podcast's detail page, we'll need to trace the journey through the application's files. Let's start by exploring the project structure to identify the relevant pages.

I will begin by listing the contents of the src/app directory, which in Expo Router applications, defines the app's routes. This will help us locate the "discover" page and then trace the navigation to the podcast detail page. <tool_code>

Okay, I see the main route groups are (auth) for authentication screens and (protected) for screens that require a user to be logged in. The "discover" page and the podcast details will be in the (protected) directory.

I'll now list the contents of the src/app/(protected) directory to find the files for the discover page and the podcast detail page. The detail page is likely a dynamic route, which would look something like [id].tsx.

Okay, we're getting closer. The (tabs) directory most likely contains the discover page. The podcast and series directories are strong candidates for the detail pages.

I'll now inspect the (tabs) directory to find what is likely the discover page. After that, I'll look inside the podcast directory. This should reveal the files we need.

Excellent. We've found the 
discover.tsx
 file, which is the starting point. Now let's look inside the podcast directory to find the detail page. It's likely a dynamic route that uses the podcast's ID. I'll list the contents of that directory.

Great, we've pinpointed the key files:

Discover Page: src/app/(protected)/(tabs)/discover.tsx
Podcast Detail Page: src/app/(protected)/podcast/[id].tsx
Now, let's examine the code within these files to understand how they work together. I'll start by viewing the contents of 
discover.tsx
 to see how it fetches and displays the list of podcasts and how it links to the detail page.
